# macOS web apps (Safari "Add to Dock")

Safari 17 / macOS Sonoma (2023-09) added **File → Add to Dock** (also in the
Share menu). Any site qualifies — a manifest is optional but honoured when
present. The app is saved to `~/Applications` and gets its own Dock icon, menu
bar and window. Source: WebKit blog 17.0; Apple Support 104996.

Per-app settings live in the web app's own Settings: name, URL, icon,
"Show navigation controls", "Show color in title bar", Privacy and Extensions.

## Manifest members on macOS

| Member             | Effect                                                                                                             |
| :----------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `name`             | App name in the Dock, menu bar and Launchpad                                                                       |
| `short_name`       | Parsed, but Apple documents only `name` for the label on macOS — treat any use as unverified                       |
| `display`          | `standalone` and `fullscreen` both hide the toolbar; `minimal-ui`, `browser` or no manifest show one               |
| `start_url`        | Loaded on launch                                                                                                   |
| `scope`            | Decides in-app vs external navigation; defaults to the origin of the page used to create the app                   |
| `id`               | Distinguishes several apps on one origin; used for Focus-mode sync; falls back to `start_url`                      |
| `icons`            | The Dock/Launchpad icon — see below                                                                                |
| `theme_color`      | See "Title bar colour" below                                                                                       |
| `background_color` | Reported to drive the title bar on Sonoma (Otto, 2023); on 26.6.2 the title bar reads `<body>` instead — see below |
| `shortcuts`        | File-menu and Dock-menu commands (Safari 17.4+)                                                                    |
| `categories`       | Launchpad folder naming (Safari 17.4+)                                                                             |
| `orientation`      | Not applicable                                                                                                     |

## Icons

- macOS reads the **manifest** `icons`, not `apple-touch-icon` (verified on
  macOS 26.6.2) and not `favicon.ico`. The manifest should be served as
  `application/manifest+json`.
- Forum 738535 reported an SVG with `sizes: any` preferred on Safari 17, but
  Safari 26.6.2 used the PNG even when the SVG was listed first. Ship opaque
  full-square PNGs at 512 and 1024; treat SVG as optional. PNG and WebP are
  accepted.
- `purpose: "maskable"` is honoured, and macOS applies its squircle mask.
- With no usable icon, Safari generates a monogram from the first letter of the
  title.
- Users can override the icon at add time and later in the app's Settings.
- On macOS 26.6.2 the icon is a flat rounded square with the system shadow
  everywhere — Dock, Finder, the Apps view, Spotlight, the Add to Dock preview
  and Safari's Open in App banner — with no Liquid Glass treatment (verified);
  Chrome PWAs on the same machine are glassed (home-assistant #3243).

## Title bar colour

The history matters here, because the behaviour has changed twice:

- **Sonoma / Safari 17.** Apple said the site's theme colour "blends into the
  toolbar". In practice Mark Otto found `theme-color` and manifest
  `theme_color` ignored, with the title bar (under the "Show color in title
  bar" setting) taking `<body>`'s `background-color`; manifest
  `background_color` did work.
- **Safari 26 on macOS 26.** Safari's own window and title bars sample page
  colour much as on iOS: `<body>`'s background, or a `fixed`/`sticky` element
  touching the top edge — reported as ≥ 90% width on macOS (vs 80% on iOS) and
  around 6px tall.
- **Safari 26 on macOS 15** does not tint at all.

Users can turn tinting off: Safari → Settings → Tabs → "Show color in tab bar"
for Safari itself, and Settings → General → "Show color in title bar" for an
installed web app. Don't rely on the tint being visible.

On macOS 26.6.2, a Dock app's title bar is a **snapshot captured at Add to
Dock**. It matched the page background at install and ignored later `<body>` and
sticky-header background changes, including after relaunch. Safari's live
sampler therefore does not apply to Dock apps. The snapshot reads `<body>`'s
background colour — verified by installing with manifest `background_color` set
to red while `<body>` stayed cream; the title bar was cream. Manifest
`background_color` therefore does not drive the title bar on 26.6.2, which also
settles Mark Otto's 2023 `background_color` observation as no longer current.
Changing the title-bar colour requires removing and re-adding the app.

The existing recipe remains right for Safari itself and for the install-time
snapshot: give `<body>` a real background colour, and give any sticky header a
real background of its own rather than letting it inherit the page.

## Cookies and storage

At Add to Dock, Safari **copies the site's cookies once** into the web app.
From then on the cookie jars are separate. Nothing else is copied — not
`localStorage`, not IndexedDB, not the cache.

The practical consequence, and Apple's own advice: keep authentication state in
cookies and users stay signed in when they install. iOS behaves the same way
(verified on iOS 26.6 — see the main skill). Website data can be cleared per
app from its Settings → Privacy.

## Navigation and scope

- In-scope links stay inside the app.
- Out-of-scope links open in the user's default browser — verified on macOS
  26.6.2 for both `target="_blank"` and same-window navigation, with a
  third-party browser as default.
- OAuth flows are an exception and stay in the app.
- On macOS 26.6.2, `window.open()` opened a new Dock-app window.
- Since Safari 18 / macOS Sequoia, links clicked **outside** Safari that match
  an installed app's `scope` open in that app; inside Safari you get a
  dismissible "Open in web app" banner.

The forum 766767 report that all external links stay in-app did not reproduce
on macOS 26.6.2. Treat it as version-specific or configuration-specific; still
test your own links on older Safari 18 builds.

Forums 766767; Joe Bell (verified macOS 26.6.2).

## Window and display modes

- `display: standalone` or `fullscreen` — no toolbar at all.
- Anything else — a toolbar with Back, Forward and Share. There is no reload
  button.
- The minimum window size is 336×186 CSS px. On macOS 26.6.2, size and
  position were **not** restored after quit/relaunch (the app reopened large);
  no manifest control over size is documented.
- Web apps participate in Cmd+Tab, Stage Manager, Mission Control, Launchpad
  and Spotlight like any other app.

## Notifications, badging, shortcuts, extensions

- Notifications display the app's icon. Sound is **off by default on macOS**
  and on by default on iOS, so set `silent` explicitly rather than relying on
  the platform default.
- Dock badging uses the Badging API; its permission comes bundled with
  notification permission.
- `shortcuts` manifest entries become File-menu and Dock-menu commands, and
  users can bind keyboard shortcuts to them in System Settings (Safari 17.4+).
- Safari Web Extensions and Content Blockers work inside web apps, configured
  per app (Safari 18+).
- iCloud Keychain and passkey AutoFill work.
- **Not supported** as of Sonoma: File System Access, Web Share Target, and the
  Window Controls Overlay API. Re-check these on current macOS before relying
  on the absence. Source: Thomas Steiner.

## Detection

Use `window.matchMedia("(display-mode: standalone)").matches`. This was wrong
in early Sonoma betas and fixed in beta 3 (WebKit bug 257806).
`navigator.standalone` is **undefined** on macOS — it is an iOS-only legacy
flag, so a detection helper that relies on it alone will report `false` inside
a Dock app. A `minimal-ui` app matches its own display-mode query.

## Debugging

Enable Safari → Settings → Advanced → "Show features for web developers", then
use Develop → _your Mac_ → _your web app_ to attach Web Inspector to a running
Dock app. Source: devtoolstips.org.

## Nothing to do on macOS

Each of these is load-bearing on iOS and inert here, so don't spend time on
them for a Mac-only target:

- `viewport-fit=cover` and every `env(safe-area-inset-*)` — a desktop window
  has no notch or home indicator, so all four insets are `0px`.
- `apple-mobile-web-app-capable`, `apple-mobile-web-app-title` and
  `apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style` — documented as iOS-only, with no
  reported effect on macOS. Harmless to leave in place for your iOS users.
- `apple-touch-startup-image` and the whole device table. No launch image
  concept is documented for macOS web apps, so **generate nothing**. (This is
  an absence of documentation rather than a documented "no".)
- The cold-launch reveal gate — there is no safe-area timing problem to hide.
- Touch CSS: `-webkit-touch-callout`, `-webkit-tap-highlight-color`,
  `touch-action`.
- Share → Add to Home Screen copy and the install-hint gating model. The macOS
  flow and its wording are different, and Safari 18's own "Open in web app"
  banner already prompts users.

## Open questions

1. Whether Apple will ever apply Liquid Glass to Dock web app icons.
2. The Safari 18-era forum 766767 link behaviour on builds older than 26.6.2.
