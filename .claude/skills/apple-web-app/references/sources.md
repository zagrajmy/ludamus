# Sources & credits

Format: **Author — Title (date) — URL** — what this skill took from it.

## Production experience

- **Joe Bell — a production home-screen web app (2025, private)** — the
  splash-set architecture (one
  device table driving both the image set and the `<link>` list, deduplicated by
  `width × height @ dpr`, cache-busted by query), the safe-area CSS variable
  mirror pattern and `base + inset` bar heights, the standalone scroll container
  and the cold-launch reveal gate (test the mirrored property for non-emptiness,
  never for `> 0`, and always ship a timeout), progressive-blur translucent
  bars, the icon/splash/`<body>` colour-matching rule, and "auth must never
  redirect the manifest, icons or splash images". Rules carrying
  "Source: Joe Bell" in this skill come from production experience, not from
  published writing. Device-verified on 2026-09-04 with
  an iPhone on iOS 26.6.x: cookies are copied once at Add to Home Screen (the
  app launches signed in), and `black-translucent` gives a transparent status
  bar on that build. Also verified 2026-09-04 on macOS 26.6.2 / Safari
  26.6.2 with a third-party browser as the default: the Dock title bar is an
  install-time snapshot; manifest icons beat `apple-touch-icon`; the PNG was
  used over an SVG listed first; no Liquid Glass on the Dock icon; the minimum
  window is 336×186 and size is not restored on relaunch; out-of-scope links
  (both `_blank` and same-window) open the default browser while `window.open`
  stays in the app. Second run the same day: the title-bar snapshot reads
  `<body>` background, not manifest `background_color`; the Apps view and
  Spotlight show the same flat icon as the Dock.
- **Joe Bell — a production Tailwind v4 app (2025, private)** — the Tailwind
  v4 reference's spellings come from the same production app.
- **Tailwind CSS — v4 documentation (`@utility`, `@custom-variant`, `--value()`)** —
  https://tailwindcss.com/docs — syntax for the Tailwind v4 reference.

## iOS PWA behaviour

- **Maximiliano Firtman — "Progressive Web Apps on iOS" (2023-06)** —
  https://firt.dev/notes/pwa-ios/ — startup images require both
  `apple-touch-startup-image` links and `apple-mobile-web-app-capable`; the
  home-screen label comes from manifest `short_name`/`name` since iOS 11.3 with
  `apple-mobile-web-app-title` as the fallback; iOS ignores manifest
  `background_color` and `orientation`; PNG icons only; `black-translucent` as
  the fullscreen mode; standalone apps have a separate storage jar (cookies
  are copied once at install, per device verification) and lose state;
  external links never open the installed app, and `scope` only governs
  in-app navigation — out-of-scope links open an in-app browser with a Done
  button rather than leaving the app (behaviour since iOS 12.2); standalone
  offers no browser back button, so the app must provide its own navigation.
- **Maximiliano Firtman — "PWA design tips" (2018-12)** —
  https://firt.dev/pwa-design-tips/ — `overscroll-behavior-y: contain`,
  `user-select: none`, `-webkit-touch-callout: none`,
  `-webkit-tap-highlight-color`, and the general "make it not feel like a web
  page" list.
- **Maximiliano Firtman — post on X (2025-06)** —

  sites as web apps; no install prompt on iOS.

  iOS 26 while the bottom safe-area inset persists.

## iOS 26 theme colour

The sampling algorithm is community reverse engineering, not Apple
documentation; thresholds are approximate.

- **r/webdev thread `1ni74bd`** —
  https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1ni74bd/ — the pointer that started
  this section. It could not be fetched from the environment this skill was
  written in, so it is cited as a pointer only; every claim taken from it is
  corroborated by the sources below.
- **Ben Frain — "iOS 26 Safari theme color: tab tinting with fixed position
  elements" (2025-11-16)** —
  https://benfrain.com/ios26-safari-theme-color-tab-tinting-with-fixed-position-elements/
  — Safari 26 ignoring `theme-color`; edge-touching fixed/sticky element
  sampling; `opacity: 0` elements still being sampled (use `display: none`).
- **Jahir Fiquitiva — "Safari toolbar" (2026-03-02)** —
  https://jahir.dev/blog/safari-toolbar — sampling thresholds (width ≥ ~80%,
  height ≥ ~3px, within ~4px of the top / ~3px of the bottom) and the
  `<body>` → `<html>` → white/black fallback chain.
- **Ben Nasedkin — "iOS 26 Safari toolbar colors"** —
  https://nasedk.in/blog/ios26-safari-toolbar-colors/ — corroboration of the

## Overlays, modals, keyboard

- **Adobe React Spectrum — PR #8888 (Devon Govett, merged 2025-09-22)** —
  https://github.com/adobe/react-spectrum/pull/8888 — and follow-up
  https://github.com/adobe/react-spectrum/pull/8922; current code in
  `packages/react-aria/src/overlays/usePreventScroll.ts`,
  `packages/react-aria/src/utils/useViewportSize.ts`,
  `packages/react-aria-components/src/Modal.tsx`,
  `packages/@adobe/react-spectrum/src/overlays/Underlay.tsx` and the Spectrum 2
  `Modal.tsx` — the whole overlay recipe: absolute backdrop sized from
  `scrollingElement`, sticky-centred dialog, `--visual-viewport-height`
  (including the `blur` refresh and the `scale` multiplication),
  `overscroll-behavior` injected via `<style>` before `touchstart`,
  `focus({ preventScroll: true })` plus manual scrolling, allowing two-finger
  and text-selection drags, `padding-bottom: 100vh` for takeovers, container
  queries, `isolation: isolate`.
- **MUI — issue #46953** — https://github.com/mui/material-ui/issues/46953 —
  independent confirmation of the iOS 26 `position: fixed` clipping.
- **Edoardo Lunardi — "Safari 26 and the strange case of fixed overlays"
  (2025-09-21)** —
  https://www.edoardolunardi.dev/blog/safari-26-and-the-strange-case-of-fixed-overlays
  — fully opaque fixed overlays failing to fill the viewport on iOS 26.0, and
  the `opacity: .99` workaround.

## Status bar & viewport heights

- **"fozzedout" — gist (2026-08)** —
  https://gist.github.com/fozzedout/5e77925381991a9570151550992baf14 — `100vh`
  being the only reliable height on a cold standalone start, `100dvh` reporting
  wrongly until layout settles, the `env()` probe technique, and the 26.1
  landscape 20pt top inset, and the edge-swipe back gesture only working once
  the standalone app has in-app history. Also reports a one-time cookie copy on
  iOS install — now confirmed (see Joe Bell entry).
- **Daniel Pietzsch — "How to create a blurry status bar for PWAs on iOS"
  (2025-09-18)** —
  https://danielpietzsch.com/articles/how-to-create-a-blurry-status-bar-for-pwas-on-ios
  — the blurred status-bar strip via `body::before { position: fixed;
height: env(safe-area-inset-top); backdrop-filter; mask }`.

## iPadOS 26 windows

- **Apple Support — "Multitask on iPad with iPadOS 26"** —

## Framework evidence

Cited only as evidence for the "emit the `apple-` capable tag yourself" rule —
this skill is framework-agnostic.

- **Next.js documentation** — https://nextjs.org/docs — and
  **vercel/next.js issue #74524** —
  https://github.com/vercel/next.js/issues/74524 — a widely used framework that
  emits only `mobile-web-app-capable` from its PWA metadata API, silently
  disabling startup images until the `apple-` prefixed tag is added by hand.

## Device data

- **ios-resolution.com** — https://www.ios-resolution.com/ — the point sizes
  and DPRs in [ios-devices.md](ios-devices.md), checked 2026-09-04 (iPhone 17e
  at 390×844@3, announced 2026-03-11; iPhone 18 unannounced at time of
  writing).

## Community skills reviewed

Both are overwhelmingly about service workers, Workbox and
`beforeinstallprompt`, i.e. outside this skill's scope. Borrowed only the
items listed.

- **`alinaqi/maggy` — `pwa-development`** (skills.sh) —
  https://github.com/alinaqi/maggy, `skills/pwa-development/SKILL.md`.
- **`curiositech/some_claude_skills` — `pwa-expert`** (skills.sh) —
  https://github.com/curiositech/some_claude_skills,
  `.claude/skills/pwa-expert/SKILL.md`.

Borrowed from those two: the
`matchMedia('(display-mode: standalone)').matches || navigator.standalone`
detection snippet; "there is no `beforeinstallprompt` on iOS, so show manual
Add to Home Screen instructions"; "delay the install hint until engagement and
persist the dismissal"; and the manifest field checklist.
